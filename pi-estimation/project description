#In this project, I used knowledge of trigonometry to create a simulation that would approximate the value of pi. 

#Using the turtle module, I created a 2x2 window with a unit circle nestled inside that window. The visual I was trying to create was one of a dartboard.
#From there, I used a random number generator and the turtle function to simulate 1000 "darts" being thrown at the dartboard. 

#With the area of the unit circle being pi and the area the 2x2 window being 4, I was able to create the following ratio:
#(darts inside circle)/(total darts) = pi/4
#Multiplying this ratio resulted in a decent pi approximation.

#Using 100 rounds of this simulation, I was able to get a value of pi out to 15 decimal places. The results are graphed using a histogram.
