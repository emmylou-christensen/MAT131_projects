#In this project, I worked with a list of the 5000 most common words in the English language, data made available by the Word Frequency data project. 

#After cleaning and organizing the data, I wrote code to calculate the sum of frequencies of:
    #all items
    #10 most common words
    #10 least common words
#I then wrote code to calculate the total usage percentage of the:
    #10 most common words
    #10 least common words

#Finally, I reconfigured the data in terms of log base 10 and graphed the relationship between the rank and frequency.
